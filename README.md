Investigating the Efficacy of Wire Lockup project using Tableau Dashboard: An In-depth analysis of Success Metrics (Sales impact, Shrink impact, Shrink ROI) and Monitor Metrics (LTSA, Sales Transactions) during pre and post installation periods in Test vs Control Stores. 


Goal: To provide valuable insights and actionable recommendations to the asset protection team through data analysis and visualization utilizing a tableau dashboard, helping them make informed decisions.

Comparison: Analyze success metrics and monitor metrics between test stores (with wire cages) and control stores (without wire cages).

Timeframe: Examine metrics during the pre-installation and post-installation periods to assess the impact of wire cages on store performance and security.

Solution: The solution involves building a dynamic and interactive Tableau dashboard by integrating data from Google BigQuery using advanced SQL queries. This synergy enables the visualization and analysis of success and monitor metrics.
